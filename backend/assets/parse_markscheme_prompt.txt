Extract all scoring points from the provided image in this exact JSON format:

[
  {
    "exam_paper_id": null,
    "question_number": "1",
    "label": "",
    "level": "main",
    "mark_code": "M1",
    "mark_content": "...",
    "ao_code": "1.1b",
    "explanation": "..."
  },
  ...
]

Label and Level rules:
- question_number is always the outer number, e.g. "2", "11"
- label is the subpart or sub-subpart, e.g. "(a)", "(a)(i)", "(b)"
- level is one of:
  - "main" if no label (i.e. whole question)
  - "sub" if label is like "(a)", "(b)"
  - "subsub" if label is like "(a)(i)", "(b)(ii)"

Additional rules:
- Do not merge label into question_number. Always keep "question_number": "2", and "label": "(a)(i)".
- Extract note lines (text after '(n marks)') and assign each one to the correct mark point.
- Match notes to marks by mark_code or label. Do not attach unmatched notes.
- Return only a JSON array. Do not include any markdown or explanation.
- Include all relevant note lines in the "explanation" field, even if they span multiple lines or continue without repeating the mark_code. Group them as a block belonging to the same mark point.
- Notes are supplemental explanations for each mark point. Match them precisely to each item using mark_code or label + mark_code. Include all matched notes in the explanation field of the corresponding mark.
